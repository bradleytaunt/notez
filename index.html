            <p>notez is a small, stupid project built by <a href="https://uglyduck.ca">Bradley Taunt</a> in order to create a minimal note taking "app". Sure, it could be cleaner or even simpler, but it fits basic needs for note-taking. (As if there aren't already enough of these apps, right?)</p>
            <p>It uses the browser's <code>localStorage</code> to keep you from losing any of your data while you write. Just remember to <strong>save as you work</strong>.</p>
